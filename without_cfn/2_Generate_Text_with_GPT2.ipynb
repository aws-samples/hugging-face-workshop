And it can’t just be any old string of syllables, you need it to be fresh, authentic, to resonate with the times and carry a sense of rhyme. You need it to delight your readers, to drive up the Tribune’s daily readership numbers and grow their social media presence. How are you going to accomplish this? With the help of Hugging Face and NLP models on SageMaker of course! "

    "\n",
    "First, think to yourself, does my organization already produce a lot of written text? Do we write documentation, scripts, blog posts, documents, answers to questions, customer messaging, etc? Odds are, you do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, ask yourself, where do we already have a large volume of written text I can easily access? That may be your existing public documentation, your existing blog posts, etc. First, run through this notebook and use some of your own data to finetune a GPT model. See how well that performs, then consider scaling to large models, including GPT-J. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you really aren't seeing the performance you want, [consider training a model from scratch!](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks/blob/main/10_transformers-from-scratch.ipynb )\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at this and other examples within [Hugging Face's SageMaker example notebooks](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/tree/master/sagemaker), and similar examples on the [SageMaker repository!](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/search?q=hugging+face)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that in order to get the best performance we **combined a variety of computer-generated and human-discriminated approaches**. Further work could improve on this by training discriminator NLP models, such as text classifiers in certain styles, to make the generation and improvement process even faster."
